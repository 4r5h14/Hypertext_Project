            <p>We were both in some classroom i guess it was like a workshop we both were attending. We both were sitting 
                far from each other like diagonally opposite. You were sitting with someone you knew, 
                not sure who it was, maybe your brother? 
                <br>
                <br>    
                We saw each other later into the workshop and got so excited hahaha 
                we got assigned a group project to tell a story using our childhood memories 
                or something and we had to create a book and we had to be creative. The person 
                in charge showed us an example of one and it was thick full of pictures and words.
                 So we became each other’s partners to work on this project. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 So we sat together and discussed stuff to put on it and created a draft.
                  The girl in charge was going around and asking us what we came up with for a 
                  specific topic she choose, to see if the childhood memories overlap between other groups. 
                  Our topic was butt and apparently we wrote a story about butt emoji ... <br>
                <br>
                The workshop ended but we had to sign out on the paper. People were all 
                over the place so i just went to the paper and signed off you and myself. 
                You were like outside the room talking to someone. I asked you if you needed a ride or not. 
                You were like no, the person you were talking to was gonna drop you off. Idk why but i like 
                stormed off and went to my car, you know how they show it in the movies skskks and then you came 
                after me and was asking me if i was all good, and i was like sulky and saying “go talk to your 
                friend who gonna drop you off” ahahhaha and then i got in the car and left, you were just standing 
                on the sidewalk.....</p>
