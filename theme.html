            <p>We were both in some classroom, apparently attending some sort of workshop. 
                We both were sitting far from each other, kind of diagonally across the room. 
                You were sitting with someone you knew, I could not tell who it was, maybe it was your brother?

        <div class = "text fadein">
        <p> We got super excited that we had to meet each other during the break!
            After the break, we sat next to each other and were assigned a group project.
            The project was to tell a story using our childhood memories 
            and we had to be creative so we decided to create a book.
            The person in charge showed us an example of one ...

               <p>  We sat together and discussed different things to put on it and created a first draft.
                  The instructor was going around and asking us what we came up with for our 
                  topic, to see if the childhood memories overlap between other groups. 
                  Our topic was butt and apparently we wrote a story about butt emoji ... üçë</p>

        <div class = "text fadeout">
               <p> The workshop ended but we had to sign out on a paper. People were all 
                over the place so I just went to the paper and signed off for you and myself. 
                You were outside the room talking to someone and I asked you if you needed a ride or not. 
                You were said "no, the person you were talking to was gonna drop you off". 
                
                <br>
                <br>

                I am not sure why but I stormed off and went to my car, you know how they show it in the movies and then you came 
                after me and was asking me if I was all good, but I was being sulky and said ‚Äúgo talk to your 
                friend who will drop you off!‚Äù I got in the car and slammed the door shut. 
                
                As I drove away, I saw in the rearview mirror that you were just standing on the sidewalk.....</p>
